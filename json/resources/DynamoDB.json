AWS CloudFormation doesn't wait for\n                the index to complete creation because the backfilling phase can take a long time,\n                depending on the size of the table. You cannot use the index or update the table\n                until the index's status is ACTIVE. You can track its status by using\n                the DynamoDB DescribeTable command.If you add or delete an index during an update, we recommend that you don't\n                update any other resources. If your stack fails to update and is rolled back while\n                adding a new index, you must manually delete the index.\n          If you update only the provisioned throughput values of global secondary\n                  indexes, you can update the table without\n                    interruption.You can delete or add one global secondary index without interruption.
