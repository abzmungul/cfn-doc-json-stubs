If you\n                  increase the Iops value (in 1,000 IOPS increments), then\n                  you must also increase the AllocatedStorage value (in 100\n                  GB increments).Indicates whether major version upgrades are allowed. Setting this parameter\n                  does not result in an outage, and the change is applied asynchronously as soon as\n                  possible.Constraints: Set this parameter to true when\n                  you specify an EngineVersion that differs from the DB instance's\n                  current major version.Indicates that minor engine upgrades are applied automatically to the DB\n                  instance during the maintenance window. The default value is\n                  true.The name of the Availability Zone where the DB instance is located. You cannot\n                  set the AvailabilityZone parameter if the\n                     MultiAZ parameter is set to true.The number of days during which automatic DB snapshots are retained.\n                  ImportantIf this DB instance is deleted or replaced during an update, AWS CloudFormation deletes\n                     all automated snapshots. However, it retains manual DB snapshots.For supported engines, specifies the character set to associate with the DB\n                  instance. For more information, see Appendix: Oracle\n                     Character Sets Supported in Amazon RDS in the\n                     Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide.If you specify the DBSnapshotIdentifier or\n                     SourceDBInstanceIdentifier property, do not specify this property.\n                  The value is inherited from the snapshot or source DB instance.Indicates whether to copy all of the user-defined tags from the DB instance to\n                  snapshots of the DB instance. By default, Amazon RDS doesn't copy tags to snapshots.\n                  Amazon RDS doesn't copy tags with the aws:: prefix unless it's the DB\n                  instance's final snapshot (the snapshot when you delete the DB instance).The name of an existing DB cluster that this instance will be associated with.\n                  If you specify this property, specify aurora for the\n                     Engine property and do not specify any of the following\n                  properties: AllocatedStorage, BackupRetentionPeriod,\n                     CharacterSetName, DBSecurityGroups,\n                     PreferredBackupWindow, PreferredMaintenanceWindow,\n                     Port, SourceDBInstanceIdentifier, or\n                     StorageType.Amazon RDS assigns the first DB instance in the cluster as the primary, and\n                  additional DB instances as replicas.The name of the compute and memory capacity classes of the DB instance.A name for the DB instance. If you specify a name, AWS CloudFormation converts it to lower\n                  case. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses\n                  that ID for the DB instance. For more information, see Name Type.ImportantIf you specify a name, you cannot do updates that require this resource to be replaced.\nYou can still do updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.The name of the DB instance that was provided at the time of creation, if one\n                  was specified. This same name is returned for the life of the DB instance.NoteIf you restore DB instances from snapshots, specify this property for the\n                     MySQL or MariaDB engines.The name of an existing DB parameter group or a reference to an AWS::RDS::DBParameterGroup\n                  resource created in the template.A list of the DB security groups to assign to the DB instance. The list can\n                  include both the name of existing DB security groups or references to AWS::RDS::DBSecurityGroup\n                  resources created in the template.If you set DBSecurityGroups, you must not set VPCSecurityGroups, and\n                  vice-versa.ImportantIf you specify this property, AWS CloudFormation sends only the following properties (if specified) to Amazon RDS: AllocatedStorageAutoMinorVersionUpgradeAvailabilityZoneBackupRetentionPeriodCharacterSetNameDbInstanceClassDbNameDbParameterGroupNameDbSecurityGroupsDbSubnetGroupNameEngineEngineVersionIopsLicenseModelMasterUsernameMasterUserPasswordMultiAZOptionGroupNamePreferredBackupWindowPreferredMaintenanceWindowAll other properties are ignored. Specify a VPC security group if you want to submit other properties, such as StorageType, StorageEncrypted, or KmsKeyId.The name or ARN of the DB snapshot used to restore the DB instance. If you are\n                  restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, you must specify the Amazon Resource\n                  Name (ARN) of the snapshot.By specifying this property, you can create a DB instance from the specified DB\n                  snapshot. If the DBSnapshotIdentifier property is an empty string or\n                  the AWS::RDS::DBInstance declaration has no\n                     DBSnapshotIdentifier property, AWS CloudFormation creates a new database. If\n                  the property contains a value (other than an empty string), AWS CloudFormation creates a\n                  database from the specified snapshot. If a snapshot with the specified name does\n                  not exist, AWS CloudFormation can't create the database and it rolls the back the stack.Some DB instance properties are not valid when you restore from a snapshot,\n                  such as the MasterUsername and MasterUserPassword\n                  properties. For information about the properties that you can specify, see the\n                     RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action in the\n                     Amazon Relational Database Service API Reference.A DB subnet group to associate with the DB instance.If there is no DB subnet group, then the instance is not a VPC DB\n                  instance.For more information about using Amazon RDS in a VPC, see Using Amazon RDS\n                     with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in the\n                     Amazon Relational Database Service Developer Guide.For an Amazon RDS DB instance that is running Microsoft SQL Server, the Active Directory\n                  directory ID to create the instance in. Amazon RDS uses Windows Authentication to\n                  authenticate users that connect to the DB instance. For more information, see\n                     Using Windows\n                     Authentication with an Amazon RDS DB Instance Running Microsoft SQL Server\n                  in the Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide.If you specify this property, you must specify a SQL Server engine for the\n              Engine property.The name of an IAM role that Amazon RDS uses when calling the Directory Service\n                  APIs.The database engine that the DB instance uses. This property is optional when\n                  you specify the DBSnapshotIdentifier property to create DB\n                  instances.For valid values, see the Engine parameter of the CreateDBInstance action in the\n                  Amazon Relational Database Service API Reference.The version number of the database engine that the DB instance uses.The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the database provisions.\n                  The value must be equal to or greater than 1000.If you specify this property, you must follow the range of allowed ratios of\n                  your requested IOPS rate to the amount of storage that you allocate (IOPS to\n                  allocated storage).  For example, you can provision an Oracle database instance\n                  with 1000 IOPS and 200 GB of storage (a ratio of 5:1) or\n                  specify 2000 IOPS with 200 GB of storage (a ratio of 10:1). For more information,\n                  see Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS\n                     Storage to Improve Performance in the\n                     Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide.The ARN of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) master key that is used to encrypt the DB\n                  instance, such as\n                     arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef.\n                  If you enable the StorageEncrypted property but don't specify this\n                  property, AWS CloudFormation uses the default master key. If you specify this property, you\n                  must set the StorageEncrypted property to true.If you specify the DBSnapshotIdentifier or\n                     SourceDBInstanceIdentifier property, do not specify this property.\n                  The value is inherited from the snapshot or source database instance.NoteIf you specify DBSecurityGroups, AWS CloudFormation ignores this property.\n                     To specify both a security group and this property, you must use a VPC security\n                     group. For more information about Amazon RDS and VPC, see Using Amazon RDS with Amazon VPC in the\n                        Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide.The license model of the DB instance.The master user name for the DB instance.NoteIf you specify the SourceDBInstanceIdentifier or\n                        DBSnapshotIdentifier property, do not specify this property.\n                     The value is inherited from the source DB instance or snapshot.The master password for the DB instance.NoteIf you specify the SourceDBInstanceIdentifier or\n                        DBSnapshotIdentifier property, do not specify this property.\n                     The value is inherited from the source DB instance or snapshot.The interval, in seconds, between points when Amazon RDS collects enhanced\n                  monitoring metrics for the DB instance. To disable metrics collection, specify\n                     0.For default and valid values, see the MonitoringInterval parameter\n                  for the CreateDBInstance action in the\n                  Amazon Relational Database Service API Reference.The ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that permits Amazon RDS to send enhanced\n            monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, for example,\n              arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess. For information on creating a\n            monitoring role, see To create an IAM\n              role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring in the\n              Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide.Specifies if the database instance is a multiple Availability Zone deployment. You cannot set the AvailabilityZone parameter if the MultiAZ parameter is set to true.The option group that this DB instance is associated with.The port for the instance.The daily time range during which automated backups are performed if automated\n                  backups are enabled, as determined by the BackupRetentionPeriod\n                  property. For valid values, see the PreferredBackupWindow parameter\n                  for the CreateDBInstance action in the\n                  Amazon Relational Database Service API Reference.The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur. For valid values, see the PreferredMaintenanceWindow parameter for the CreateDBInstance action in the Amazon Relational Database Service API Reference.NoteThis property applies when AWS CloudFormation initially creates the DB instance. If\n                        you use AWS CloudFormation to update the DB instance, those updates are applied\n                        immediately.Indicates whether the DB instance is an Internet-facing instance. If you\n                  specify true, AWS CloudFormation creates an instance with a publicly resolvable\n                  DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address. If you specify\n                  false, AWS CloudFormation creates an internal instance with a DNS name that\n                  resolves to a private IP address. The default behavior value depends on your VPC setup and the database subnet\n                  group. For more information, see the PubliclyAccessible parameter in\n                     CreateDBInstance in the Amazon Relational Database Service API Reference.If this resource has a public IP address and is also in a VPC that is defined in the same template, you must use the\nDependsOn attribute to declare a dependency on the VPC-gateway attachment. For more information,\nsee DependsOn Attribute.NoteIf you specify DBSecurityGroups, AWS CloudFormation ignores this property.\n                     To specify a security group and this property, you must use a VPC security\n                     group. For more information about Amazon RDS and VPC, see Using Amazon RDS with Amazon VPC in the\n                        Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide.If you want to create a read replica DB instance, specify the ID of the source\n                  DB instance. Each DB instance can have a limited number of read replicas. For more\n                  information, see Working with Read\n                     Replicas in the Amazon Relational Database Service Developer Guide.The SourceDBInstanceIdentifier property determines whether a DB\n                  instance is a read replica. If you remove the\n                     SourceDBInstanceIdentifier property from your template and then\n                  update your stack, AWS CloudFormation deletes the read replica and creates a new DB instance\n                  (not a read replica).ImportantRead replicas do not support deletion policies. AWS CloudFormation ignores any\n                           deletion policy that's associated with a read replica.If you specify SourceDBInstanceIdentifier, do not set the\n                              MultiAZ property to true and do not specify\n                           the DBSnapshotIdentifier property. You cannot deploy read\n                           replicas in multiple Availability Zones, and you cannot create a read\n                           replica from a snapshot.Do not set the BackupRetentionPeriod,\n                           DBName, MasterUsername,\n                              MasterUserPassword, and\n                              PreferredBackupWindow properties. The database attributes\n                           are inherited from the source DB instance, and backups are disabled for\n                           read replicas.If the source DB instance is in a different region than the read\n                           replica, specify an ARN for a valid DB instance. For more information,\n                           see Constructing a Amazon RDS Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the\n                              Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide.For DB instances in Amazon Aurora clusters, do not specify this\n                           property. Amazon RDS automatically assigns writer and reader DB\n                           instances.Indicates whether the DB instance is encrypted.If you specify the DBClusterIdentifier,\n                     DBSnapshotIdentifier, or SourceDBInstanceIdentifier\n                  property, do not specify this property. The value is inherited from the cluster,\n                  snapshot, or source DB instance.The storage type associated with this DB instance.For the default and valid values, see the StorageType parameter of\n                  the CreateDBInstance action in the\n                  Amazon Relational Database Service API Reference.An arbitrary set of tags (key–value pairs) for this DB instance.A list of the VPC security group IDs to assign to the DB instance. The list can\n                  include both the physical IDs of existing VPC security groups and references to\n                     AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup resources created in the\n                  template.If you set VPCSecurityGroups, you must not set DBSecurityGroups, and vice\n                  versa.ImportantYou\n              can migrate a\n              DB\n              instance in your stack from an RDS DB security group to a VPC security group, but\n              keep\n              the\n              following in mind:You cannot revert to using an RDS security group after you\n                           establish a VPC security group membership.When you migrate your DB instance to VPC security groups, if your\n                           stack update rolls back because the DB instance update fails, or because\n                           an update fails in another AWS CloudFormation resource, the rollback will fail because\n                           it cannot revert to an RDS security group. To avoid this situation, migrate your DB instance to using VPC security\n                     groups only when that is the only change in your stack template.",
