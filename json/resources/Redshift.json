If you set the value\n                  to 0, automated snapshots are disabled.The Amazon EC2 Availability Zone in which you want to provision your Amazon Redshift cluster.\n                  For example, if you have several Amazon EC2 instances running in a specific\n                  Availability Zone, you might want the cluster to be provisioned in the same zone\n                  in order to decrease network latency.The name of the parameter group that you want to associate with this\n                  cluster.A list of security groups that you want to associate with this cluster.The name of a cluster subnet group that you want to associate with this\n                  cluster.The type of cluster. You can specify single-node or\n                     multi-node.The Amazon Redshift engine version that you want to deploy on the cluster.The name of the first database that is created when the cluster is\n                  created.The Elastic IP (EIP) address for the cluster.Indicates whether the data in the cluster is encrypted at rest.Specifies the name of the HSM client certificate that the Amazon Redshift cluster uses to\n                  retrieve the data encryption keys stored in an HSM.Specifies the name of the HSM configuration that contains the information that\n                  the Amazon Redshift cluster can use to retrieve and store keys in an HSM.The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key ID that you want to use to encrypt data in the\n                  cluster.The user name that is associated with the master user account for this\n                  cluster.The  password associated with the master user account for this cluster.The node type that is provisioned for this cluster.The number of compute nodes in the cluster.
