You can\n            specify an integer value from 1024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262144\n            bytes (256 KiB). The default value is 262144 (256 KiB).The number of seconds Amazon SQS retains a message. You can specify an integer value from\n              60 seconds (1 minute) to 1209600 seconds (14 days). The\n            default value is 345600 seconds (4 days).A name for the queue. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical\n            ID and uses that ID for the queue name. For more information, see Name Type.ImportantIf you specify a name, you cannot do updates that require this resource to be replaced.\nYou can still do updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.Specifies the duration, in seconds, that the ReceiveMessage action call\n            waits until a message is in the queue in order to include it in the response, as opposed\n            to returning an empty response if a message is not yet available. You can specify an\n            integer from 1 to 20. The short polling is used as the default\n            or when you specify 0 for this property.

This blocks other components from receiving the same message and gives the initial component time to process and delete the message from the queue.Values must be from 0 to 43200 seconds (12 hours). If no value is specified, the default value of\n                  30 seconds will be used.For more information about SQS Queue visibility timeouts, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer\n                     Guide.Returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the queue.
